The proof-of-concept game, which shows that HTML5 Canvas can be used to create real mobile games. It runs in the desktop browser, Android and iOS. To package it for mobile platforms I used [CocoonJS](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs).

Read my [blog post](http://mihhaillapushkin.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/the-makings-of-a-mobile-canvas-game) for more details about this project.
